/*You can import fonts directly into stylesheets with the @font-face property.
Instead of entering the URL into the HTML document put it in your browser.
The browser will load the CSS rules. Copy each of the CSS rules labeled latin and paste the rules into your stylesheet.
They must be on top of the stylesheet for the font to load properly.*/
