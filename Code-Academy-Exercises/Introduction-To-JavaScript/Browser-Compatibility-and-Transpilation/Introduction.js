/*Browsers are updated for reasons such as supporting new HTML, CSS, and JavaScript syntax.
After ES6 was released developers quickly adopted the new ES6 Syntax but it wasn't supported by many browsers.
caniuse.com provides data on web browser compatibility for HTML,CSS and JS features. Babel can be used to convert new, unspported JS
to an older version that is recognized by most browsers.*/
