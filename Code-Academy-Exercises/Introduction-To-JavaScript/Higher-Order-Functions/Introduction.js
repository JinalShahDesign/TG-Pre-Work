/*In programming we can accomplish "abstraction" by
writing functions. In addition to allowing us to reuse our code, functions help to make clear readable programs.
Higher-order functions are functions that accept other functions as arguments and/or return functions as output.
This allows us to build abstractions on other abstractions.*/
