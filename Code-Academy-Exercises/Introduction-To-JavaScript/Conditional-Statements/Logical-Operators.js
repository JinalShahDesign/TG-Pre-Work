//Working with conditionals means that we will be using booleans (true or false). Logical operators also work with boolean values. You can use logical operators to add more sophisticated logic to our conditionals. There are 3 operators && (and) || (or), ! (bang). When using a && operator, both conditions must evaluate to true for the entire condition. The or || will only care about one condition being true. The ! not operator reverses the value of a boolean.
